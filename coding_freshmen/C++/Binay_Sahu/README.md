# MAXIMUM_SUM
  Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
We have to find the subarray with the largest sum possible in the array.

# Your logic ðŸ¤¯
* Solved using kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray in an integer array.

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

```cpp
Time Complexity -> O(n)
Space Complexity -> O(1)

```
