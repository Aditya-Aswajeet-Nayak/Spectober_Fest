# Problem Explanation ðŸš€

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
In order to solve this problem, I needed to first understand how to read roman numerals and translate them my hand.

# Your logic ðŸ¤¯

- 1.(ADDING) The value of each symbol is (generally) added together from left to right:
  MMLVII (1,000+1,000+50+5+1+1) = 2,057 2. (SUBTRACTING) When there is a smaller number placed before a larger number
  XIX (10 + (10 âˆ’ 1)) = 19

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity -> O(n)
Space Complexity -> O(n)

```
