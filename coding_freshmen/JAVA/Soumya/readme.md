# 1. Problem Title: Sorting
  You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order.
Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array [Basically you have to sort the array]

# Problem Explanation ðŸš€
Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array [Basically you have to sort the array].  

# Logic and Intuition ðŸ§ 

* I used the Java util package for it Scanner class for input and Arrays.sort method to sort the array in ascending order.
* Own test cases if any:
*     Input array: [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
*     Output array: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
*     
*     Input array: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
*     Output array: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
*

// Auxiliary Space: O(1)
